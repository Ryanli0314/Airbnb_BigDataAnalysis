# Airbnb_BigDataAnalysis
This Python project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Airbnb dataset. The Jupyter Notebook (Airbnb_BigDataProject.ipynb) begins by importing necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation, then matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, finally scikit-learn for machine learning.

For details, two separate pdf are upload for further analysis results.
